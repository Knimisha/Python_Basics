# first we need to create a list

#list1 = [1,2,4,5,8,10, "hello", "world"]
#for i in list1:
#    print(i)




#another example of for loop with list

#for i in "World":
#    print (i)


# for loop with multiple numeric value
#write a program to add all the numeric value in list

li = [12, 45, 78, 200, 189]
z = 0
for i in li:
    z = z+i

print("The sum is " + str(z))
